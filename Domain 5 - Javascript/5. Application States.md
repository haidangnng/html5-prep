# SESSION STATE vs. APP STATE

| **Aspect**             | **Session State**                                                                                  | **App State**                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**         | Refers to data or state that persists only for the duration of a user's session.                   | Refers to the overall state of an application, which may persist across sessions or be shared. |
| **Scope**              | User-specific: Limited to a single user session.                                                   | Application-wide: Shared across users or instances.                                            |
| **Lifespan**           | Exists only while the session is active (e.g., until the user logs out or closes the browser).     | Can persist indefinitely, even after the application restarts or users end their sessions.     |
| **Storage**            | Stored in session-related mechanisms, such as browser session storage, cookies, or server memory.  | Stored in more permanent locations, such as databases, files, or cloud storage.                |
| **Examples**           | - User authentication token<br>- Shopping cart contents for a single session                       | - Global configuration settings<br>- Application theme or layout<br>- Caching system results   |
| **Persistence**        | Temporary: Typically does not survive a browser or app restart.                                    | Persistent: Often survives application or device restarts.                                     |
| **Usage Context**      | Used for maintaining state while interacting with a specific user during their session.            | Used for managing shared data, configuration, or system-wide functionality.                    |
| **Implementation**     | Managed with tools like sessions in web frameworks (e.g., PHP, ASP.NET, Flask) or session cookies. | Managed through databases, centralized state management libraries (e.g., Redux), or caching.   |
| **Performance Impact** | Lightweight, since it's often scoped to individual users and is time-limited.                      | Can be resource-intensive, as it often involves more data and longer lifetimes.                |

## **When to Use Each**

### **Session State**
- **Best for**:
  - Temporary data specific to a user.
  - Short-lived information like login credentials or temporary user preferences.
- **Examples**:
  - Shopping carts in e-commerce sites (session-only).
  - User progress in a form wizard.

### **App State**
- **Best for**:
  - Persistent, shared, or global data.
  - Data required by multiple users or across multiple app instances.
- **Examples**:
  - Caching expensive database queries.
  - Configurations such as app themes or APIs.

---

## **Summary**
- **Session State** focuses on maintaining a temporary, user-specific state, while **App State** deals with the global, persistent, or shared state of the entire application. Both are essential in modern applications but serve different purposes depending on the context.

## EXAM NOTES
- Understand the differences between Session State and Application State.


# LOCAL STORAGE vs. SESSION STORAGE

| **Aspect**         | **Local Storage**                                                                                     | **Session Storage**                                                                                |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**      | A web storage mechanism for storing data with no expiration, persisting even after the browser closes. | A web storage mechanism for storing data that lasts only for the duration of the page session.  |
| **Lifespan**        | Persistent: Data remains stored until explicitly removed by the user or the application.              | Temporary: Data is cleared as soon as the browser tab or window is closed.                      |
| **Scope**           | Shared across all tabs and windows of the same origin (domain).                                       | Limited to the specific tab or window where it was created.                                      |
| **Storage Capacity**| Typically allows up to **5-10 MB** of data, depending on the browser.                                 | Similar capacity as Local Storage, typically **5 MB**.                                           |
| **Data Access**     | Accessible across all tabs/windows of the same origin.                                               | Accessible only in the tab/window where it was set.                                              |
| **Use Cases**       | - Persisting user preferences<br>- Storing authentication tokens<br>- Caching application data       | - Temporary form data<br>- Storing session-specific flags<br>- Tracking page session progress   |
| **Data Expiration** | Data persists indefinitely unless explicitly removed.                                                | Data is automatically removed when the session ends (browser tab or window is closed).          |
| **Accessibility**   | Available via `window.localStorage`.                                                                 | Available via `window.sessionStorage`.                                                          |
| **Security Concerns**| Data is accessible to JavaScript and thus vulnerable to XSS attacks.                                | Similar vulnerabilities to XSS attacks as Local Storage.                                         |

## **Key Differences**

1. **Persistence**:
   - **Local Storage**: Persistent and survives browser restarts.
   - **Session Storage**: Temporary and ends with the session (tab or window closure).

2. **Scope**:
   - **Local Storage**: Shared across all tabs/windows of the same origin.
   - **Session Storage**: Limited to the current tab or window.

3. **Use Cases**:
   - **Local Storage**: Ideal for saving data that needs to persist over time, such as user preferences or offline data caching.
   - **Session Storage**: Best for temporary, session-specific data like unsaved form progress or session-specific identifiers.

## EXAM NOTES
- Be able to identify which storage type is best given a scenario.
- Know which methods to manipulate data in both localStorage and sessionStorage.
