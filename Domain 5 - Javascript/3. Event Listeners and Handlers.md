### SOURCES
- [Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event)

The Event interface represents any occurrence on an EventTarget (such as elements, documents, or windows).

Events can be triggered in various ways:

- User Actions: Examples include clicking a mouse button or pressing a key.
- API-Generated Events: For instance, events representing the progress of an asynchronous task.
- Programmatically Triggered Events: By methods like HTMLElement.click() or by creating and dispatching a custom event with EventTarget.dispatchEvent().

There are numerous event types, and some use specialized interfaces derived from the main Event interface. The Event interface itself provides the basic properties and methods that are shared across all event types.
# GESTURE EVENTS

The `addEventListener()` method of the `EventTarget` interface sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified event is delivered to the target.

Common targets are `Element`, or its children, `Document`, and `Window`, but the target may be any object that supports events (such as IDBRequest).

```javascript
addEventListener(type, listener)
addEventListener(type, listener, options)
addEventListener(type, listener, useCapture)
```

- **type**: A case-sensitive string representing the [event type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) to listen for.
- **listener**: The object that receives a notification when an event of the specified type occurs. This must be a `null` , an object with a `handleEvent()` method, or a JS function.
- **options**: An object that specifies characteristics about the event listener:
	- ***capture***: A boolean value indicating that events of this type will be dispatched to the registered listener before dispatched to any EventTarget beneath it in the DOM tree. (default to false)
	- ***once***: A boolean value indicating that the listener should be invoked at most once after being added. (default to false)
	- ***passive***: A boolean value indicating that the function specified by listener will never call `preventDefault()`. (default to false)
- **useCapture**: A boolean value indicating that events of this type will be dispatched to the registered listener before dispatched to any EventTarget beneath it in the DOM tree. (default to false)

### EXAM NOTES
