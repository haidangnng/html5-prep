# SEND AND RECEIVE DATA

In this section, we will focus on the concept of [AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/AJAX) and [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) (XHR) object.

Nowadays, [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) is more popular, but XHR is still used today, and it's the method that mentioned in the exam.

***AJAX***

Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (**Ajax**, or **AJAX**) is a web development technique in which a web app fetches content from the server by making asynchronous HTTP requests, and uses the new content to update the relevant parts of the page without requiring a full page load. This can make the page more responsive, because only the parts that need to be updated are requested.

Ajax was implemented using the XMLHttpRequest

***XMLHttpRequest (XHR)

XHR objects are used to interact with servers. You can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh.
XHR can be used on:
- Text files
- XML files
- JSON files
- ...

To send an HTTP request:
1. Create an `XMLHttpRequest` object
2. Open a URL
3. Send the request

```javascript
const request = new XMLHttpRequest();

request.addEventListener("readystatechange", function () {
	if (request.readyState === 4 && request.status === 200) {
		data = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
		console.log("data=>", data.catalog);
	} else {
		console.log("Request not ready", {
			readyState: request.readyState,
			status: request.status,
		})
	}
});

request.open("GET", "json/books.json");
request.send();
```

### EXAM NOTES

- Know what AJAX stands for and why it is used.
- Have an understanding of the XMLHttpRequest object and how it helps process server requests outside of the traditional page-loading process.
- Know that XMLHttpRequest is not submitted until the `send()` method is called.

# XML
f
XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a versatile markup language comparable to HTML, but it doesn’t rely on predefined tags. Instead, you create custom tags tailored to your specific requirements. This makes XML an effective format for storing data in a way that is easy to search, share, and store. A key advantage of XML is its standardized structure, which ensures that data transmitted between systems or platforms—whether locally or online—can be parsed correctly by the recipient, thanks to its universal syntax.

```xml
<book>
  <title>The Great Gatsby</title>
  <author>F. Scott Fitzgerald</author>
  <year>1925</year>
  <genre>Fiction</genre>
</book>
```
### EXAM NOTES

- Know what XML is and what XML stands for.
- Uses a similar syntax to HTML.
- With tags that are unique to the data.
- Organized as a tree.
- Has a root, child elements and sub-children.

# JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and simple for machines to parse and generate. It represents data as key-value pairs and organizes it in a hierarchical structure using objects ({}) and arrays ([]). JSON is widely used for APIs, configuration files, and data exchange across platforms due to its simplicity and compatibility with many programming languages.

```json
{
  "book": {
    "title": "The Great Gatsby",
    "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
    "year": 1925,
    "genre": "Fiction"
  }
}
```

You can use the JSON.parse() method to convert the above JSON string into a JavaScript object:

```javascript
let book = `{
    "title": "The Great Gatsby",
    "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
    "year": 1925,
    "genre": "Fiction"
}`

let parsedBook = JSON.parse(book);
console.log(parseBook.title)
```

| Feature               | **XML (Extensible Markup Language)**<br> | **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Structure**         | Hierarchical with custom tags            | Key-value pairs using objects and arrays       |
| **Readability**       | Verbose, harder to read                  | Compact and easier to read/write               |
| **Data Type Support** | Text only (needs attributes)             | Supports strings, numbers, booleans, etc.      |
| **Schema Validation** | Strong schema (XSD, DTD support)         | Schema support is optional (e.g., JSON Schema) |
| **Parsing Speed**     | Slower due to verbosity                  | Faster and more lightweight                    |
| **File Size**         | Larger, due to tag overhead              | Smaller, uses fewer characters                 |
| **Compatibility**     | Widely used for older systems            | Modern standard for APIs and web apps          |
| **Namespaces**        | Supports namespaces for elements         | No direct support for namespaces               |
| **Extensibility**     | Highly extensible                        | Limited to basic data structures               |
| **Use Cases**         | Complex documents, config files          | Data exchange (APIs), lightweight configs      |
| **Ease of Use**       | Requires additional effort to parse      | Simple to parse in most programming languages  |
| **Support**           | Older and widely supported               | Modern and increasingly preferred              |

### EXAM NOTES

- XML uses opening and closing tags, while JSON uses key-value pairs in a hierarchical structure, which can contain strings, integers, boolean values, nulls, arrays, or nested object.
- JSON is more compact and commonly used for APIs and data interchange.
- JSON is stored and transported as text data, not as objects.
- JSON data must be parsed using `JSON.parse()` method to be treated as a JS object.


# LOAD AND SAVE FILES

### EXAM NOTES
- Not important to memorize the process. However, you should have a basic understanding of the FileReader object and the File object.
- FileReader object can be used to read text files, among other things.
- File object can be used to create files within JS, which the browser can then download.
