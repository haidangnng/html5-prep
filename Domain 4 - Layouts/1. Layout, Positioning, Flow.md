# INTRODUCTION

Responsive web design (RWD) is a web design approach to make web pages render well on all screen sizes and resolutions while ensuring good usability. It is the way to design for a multi-device web. In this article, we'll help you understand some techniques that can be used to master it.

# CONTENT FLOW

- *Normal Flow*: explains that any boxes in normal flow will be part of a formatting context. They can be either block or inline, but not both at once.

For elements with a *block* formatting context:

 >In a block formatting context, boxes are laid out one after the other, vertically, beginning at the top of a containing block. The vertical distance between two sibling boxes is determined by the 'margin' properties. Vertical margins between adjacent block-level boxes in a block formatting context collapse.   
 >In a block formatting context, each box's left outer edge touches the left edge of the containing block (for right-to-left formatting, right edges touch)." - 9.4.1

For elements with an *inline* formatting context:

> "In an inline formatting context, boxes are laid out horizontally, one after the other, beginning at the top of a containing block. Horizontal margins, borders, and padding are respected between these boxes. The boxes may be aligned vertically in different ways: their bottoms or tops may be aligned, or the baselines of text within them may be aligned. The rectangular area that contains the boxes that form a line is called a line box." - 9.4.2

The `display` CSS property sets whether an element is treated as a block or inline box and the layout used for it's children, such as `flow layout`, `grid`, `flex`.

## SYNTAX
```css
/* precomposed values */
display: block;
display: inline;
display: inline-block;
```

The `display` property values can be grouped into six value categories, however, in this section, we mainly focus on the element's outer display type, which is essentially its role in flow layout:

- `block`: The element generates a block box, generating line breaks both before and after the element when in the normal flow.
- `inline`: The element generates one or more inline boxes that do not generate line breaks before or after themselves. In normal flow, the next element will be on the same line if there is space.
- `inline-block`: The element generates a block box that will be flowed with surrounding content as if it were a single inline box (behaving much like a replaced element would).

### EXAM NOTES
- Be able to recognize elements that are display `block` vs `inline` vs `inline-block`.
- Recognize that block elements will take up the full width of their containers, whereas inline elements will try to display side by side with other inline.
- Be aware that `inline` elements cannot accept width and height values.

# ELEMENT POSITIONING

All of the elements are considered "in flow"; they appear on the page in the order that they are in the source.

## FLOAT

The `float` CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. The element is removed from the normal flow of the page, though still remaining a part of the flow.

```css
/* Keyword values */
float: left;
float: right;
float: none;
```

- `left`: The element must float on the left side of its containing block.
- `right`: The element must float on the right side of its containing block.
- `none`: The element must not float.

Usually use to position text around an image. It can also be used for overall page layout.

## ABSOLUTE POSITIONING

An absolutely positioned element is an element whose computed position value is absolute or fixed. The top, right, bottom, and left properties specify offsets from the edges of the element's containing block. (The containing block is the ancestor relative to which the element is positioned.) If the element has margins, they are added to the offset.

```css
position: absolute
position: relative
```

- `absolute`: The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. The element is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor (if any) or to the initial [containing block](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Containing_block#identifying_the_containing_block). Its final position is determined by the values of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`.

- `relative`: The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset _relative to itself_ based on the values of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`.

# CONTENT OVERFLOW

The **`overflow`** [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [shorthand property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties) sets the desired behavior when content does not fit in the element's padding box (overflows) in the horizontal and/or vertical direction.

## SYNTAX
```css
overflow: visible;
overflow: hidden;
overflow: clip;
overflow: scroll;
overflow: auto;
overflow: hidden visible;
```

# BASIC CSS STYLING

## [CSS RESETS](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)

CSS resets are stylesheets or rules designed to remove the default styling applied by web browsers to HTML elements. Every browser has its own default styles, which can lead to inconsistencies when building web pages. A CSS reset eliminates these discrepancies by "resetting" all styles to a baseline, ensuring consistent rendering across browsers.

## Why Use CSS Resets?

1. **Cross-browser Consistency**:
	- Different browsers apply varying default styles to elements (e.g., margins, padding, font sizes).
	- A reset ensures a unified starting point for your custom styles.
2. **Better Control**:
	- By removing default styles, you gain more control over how elements are styled.
3. **Simplified Development**:
	- Developers donâ€™t need to account for default styles when building a page.

## [BOX SIZING](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing)

The **`box-sizing`** [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets how the total width and height of an element is calculated.

By default in the CSS box model, the width and height you assign to an element is applied only to the element's content box. If the element has any border or padding, this is then added to the width and height to arrive at the size of the box that's rendered on the screen. This means that when you set width and height, you have to adjust the value you give to allow for any border or padding that may be added.

The box-sizing property can be used to adjust this behavior:

- `content-box`: gives you the default CSS box-sizing behavior. If you set an element's width to 100 pixels, then the element's content box will be 100 pixels wide, and the width of any border or padding will be added to the final rendered width, making the element wider than 100px.

- `border-box`: tells the browser to account for any border and padding in the values you specify for an element's width and height. If you set an element's width to 100 pixels, that 100 pixels will include any border or padding you added, and the content box will shrink to absorb that extra width. This typically makes it much easier to size elements.

## EXAM NOTES
- Know what CSS reset is and its purpose.
- Know about box-size property and its value.
