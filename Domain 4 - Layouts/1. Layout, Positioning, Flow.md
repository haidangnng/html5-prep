# INTRODUCTION

Responsive web design (RWD) is a web design approach to make web pages render well on all screen sizes and resolutions while ensuring good usability. It is the way to design for a multi-device web. In this article, we'll help you understand some techniques that can be used to master it.


# CONTENT FLOW

- *Normal Flow*: explains that any boxes in normal flow will be part of a formatting context. They can be either block or inline, but not both at once.

For elements with a *block* formatting context:

 >In a block formatting context, boxes are laid out one after the other, vertically, beginning at the top of a containing block. The vertical distance between two sibling boxes is determined by the 'margin' properties. Vertical margins between adjacent block-level boxes in a block formatting context collapse.   
 >In a block formatting context, each box's left outer edge touches the left edge of the containing block (for right-to-left formatting, right edges touch)." - 9.4.1

For elements with an *inline* formatting context:

> "In an inline formatting context, boxes are laid out horizontally, one after the other, beginning at the top of a containing block. Horizontal margins, borders, and padding are respected between these boxes. The boxes may be aligned vertically in different ways: their bottoms or tops may be aligned, or the baselines of text within them may be aligned. The rectangular area that contains the boxes that form a line is called a line box." - 9.4.2
