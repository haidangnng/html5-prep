- [Client-side form validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Form_validation)

One of the key advantages of form controls is their built-in ability to validate user data directly in the browser, without requiring JavaScript. This functionality is enabled through the use of validation attributes on form elements.

### REQUIRED
- Ensures that the user must fill out a form field before submitting.

```html
<input type="text" name="username" required>
```

### MINLENGTH and MAXLENGTH
- Sets the minimum and maximum number of characters allowed in a text field.

```html
<input type="text" name="password" minlength="8" maxlength="20" required>
```

### MIN and MAX
- Specifies the minimum and maximum value for numeric inputs.

```html
<input type="number" name="age" min="18" max="100" required>
```

### PATTERN
- Defines a regular expression that the input must match.

```html
<input type="text" name="zipcode" pattern="\d{5}" title="Please enter a 5-digit ZIP code">
```

### TYPE
- Certain input types automatically validate data, such as:
	- email
	- url
	- number
	- date
	- file
	- password
	- tel
	- [...](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#input_types)

```html
<input type="email" name="userEmail" required>
```

### STEP
- Specifies the increments for numeric inputs.

```html
<input type="number" name="price" step="0.01" min="0" required>
```

### PLACEHOLDER
- Provides a hint for the expected input, but does not validate data.

```html
<input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">
```

### NOVALIDATE
- Disables the form's builtin validation.

```html
<form novalidate>
```

# Benefits of Using HTML Validation

- **No Extra Code**: Reduces the need for JavaScript validation scripts.
- **User-Friendly**: Provides immediate feedback to users.
- **Customizable Messages**: Use the title attribute to offer specific error instructions.
- **Cross-Browser Support**: Most modern browsers support these attributes.

# Limitations of HTML Validation

While HTML validation is convenient, it does have some limitations:

- **Customization**: Built-in validation error messages can be browser-dependent and may not match your application's style.
- **Security**: Server-side validation is still essential, as HTML validation can be bypassed by malicious users.
- **Complex Rules**: Advanced validation logic often requires JavaScript or server-side processing.
