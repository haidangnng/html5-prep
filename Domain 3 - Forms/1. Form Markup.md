# FORM ELEMENTS

HTML provides several elements that can be used together to create forms that the user can fill out and submit to the website or application:
- `<button>`: An interactive element activated by user and performs actions, such as submitting form or open dialog.
- `<datalist>`: Contains a set of `<option>` elements that represent the permissible or recommended options available to choose from within other controls.
- `<fieldset>`: Used to group several controls as well as `<label>` within a web form.
- `<form>`: Represents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information.
- `<input>`: Used to create interactive controls for web forms to accept data from the user.
- `<label>`: Represents a caption for an item in a user interface.
- `<legend>`: Represents a caption for the content of its parent `<fieldset>`.
- `<meter>`: Represents either a scalar value within a known range or a fractional value.
- `<option>`: Used to define an item contained in a select (e.g. `<datalist>`) element.
- `<output>`: Displays an indicator showing the completion progress of a task, typically displayed as a progress bar.
