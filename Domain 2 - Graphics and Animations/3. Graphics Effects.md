# Rounded Corners, Shadows, and Transparency

## Rounded Corners

The `border-radius` property rounds the corners of an element's outer border edge. You can set a single radius to make a circular corners, or two radii to make elliptical corners.

```css
border-radius: 30px;
border-radius: 25% 15%;
```

The radius applies to the whole `background`, even if the element has no border.

## Shadows

The `box-shadow` property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur, and spread radius, and color.

```css
box-shadow: 10px 5px 5px red;
box-shadow: 60px -16px teal;
box-shadow: inset 5em 1em gold;
box-shadow: 3px 3px red, -1em 0 .4em olive;
```

The `box-shadow` property enables you to cast a drop shadow from the frame of almost any element. If a `border-radius` is specified on the element with a box shadow, the box shadow takes on the same rounded corners. The z-ordering of multiple box shadows is the same as multiple `text-shadows` (the first specified shadow is on top)

## Transparency

The `opacity` property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the degree to which content behind an element is hidden, and is the opposite of `transparency`.

```css
opacity: 0; /*The element is fully transparent (that is, invisible).*/
opacity: 0.5; /*The element is translucent (that is, content behind the element can be seen).*/
opacity: 1; /*The element is fully opaque*/
```

## Exam notes:
- Be able to recognize the three mentioned CSS properties, understand the parameters and how they affect an element.

# Background Gradients

Background gradients allow smooth transitions between two or more colors, creating visually appealing backgrounds without using images. CSS supports multiple types of gradients:

1. Linear Gradient - Colors blend in a straight line.
```css
background: linear-gradient(to right, red, blue);	
```
2. Radial Gradient - Colors spread outward from a center point.
```css
background: radial-gradient(circle, yellow, green);	
```
3. Conic Gradient - Colors rotate around a center point.
```css
background: linear-gradient(from 0deg, red, yellow, blue);	
```

Gradients can also be combined, repeated, and customized with transparency (RGBA) and multiple color stops for more complex designs.

## Exam notes
- Be able to recognize and differentiate background gradients' value and parameter.

# Typography and WOFF

Typography refers to the style, arrangement, and appearance of text on a webpage. It plays a crucial role in web design, affecting readability, accessibility, and user experience.

## Key aspects of Typography

- *Font Family*: The typeface used (e.g., Arial, Times New Roman, Roboto)
- *Font size*: The size of the text, usually in `px`, `em`, `rem`, or `%`
- *Font Weight*: Thickness of the font (e.g., normal, bold, 100-900)
- *Line Height*: Spacing between lines for better readability
- *Letter Spacing*: Adjusts space between characters
- *Text Alignment*: Controls text positioning (`left`,`right`,`center`,`justify`)
```css
body { 
	font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
	font-size: 16px; 
	line-height: 1.5; 
}
```

## WOFF

WOFF (Web Open Font Format) is a font format specifically designed for web use. It allows websites to embed custom fonts while ensuring fast loading and compatibility across browsers.

### Key Features of WOFF

- *Compress*: Smaller file size to traditional formats like TTF or OTF
- *Supports Metadata*: Contains font licensing and copyright info
- *Cross-browser Compatible*: Works with all modern browsers
- *WOFF2*: A more optimized version for better compression and performance

### How to use WOFF

To embed a WOFF font, use `@font-face`:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'MyCustomFont';
  src: url('fonts/myfont.woff2') format('woff2'),
       url('fonts/myfont.woff') format('woff');
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
}
```

Then apply it:
```css
body {
  font-family: 'MyCustomFont', sans-serif;
}
```

Using WOFF ensures that your web typography remains consistent across different devices and platforms.

# 2D and 3D Transformations

CSS Transformations allow you to visually manipulate elements by changing their shape, size, position, and orientation affecting the document flow.

## 2D Transformations
2D transformations operate in a two-dimensional plane (X and Y axes).

1. `translate(x,y)` - Moves an element along the X and Y axes
```css
transform: translate(50px, 20px)
```

2. `rotate(angle)` - Rotates an element around its center
```css
transform: rotate(45deg)
```

3. `scale(x,y)` - Resizes an element (scales it up or down)
```css
transform: scale(1.5, 1.5)
```

4. `skew(x angle, y angle)` - Slants an element along the X and Y axes
```css
transform: skew(20deg, 20deg)
```

## 3D Transformations
3D Transformations extend the effects into three dimension (X, Y, Z axes)

1. rotateX(angle) - Rotates an element around the X-axis
```css
transform: rotateX(60deg)
```
2. rotateY(angle) - Rotates an element around the Y-axis
```css
transform: rotateY(60deg)
```
3. rotateZ(angle) - Rotates an element around the Z-axis
```css
transform: rotateZ(60deg)
```
4. translate3D(x, y, z) - Moves an element in 3D space
```css
transform: translate3d(50px, 20px, 30px)
```
5. scale3d(x, y, z) - Scales an element in 3D space
```css
transform: scale3D(1.2, 1.2, 1.2)
```
6. perspective(value) - Defines the depth perspective for 3D transformations
```css
perspective: 500px
```

## Combining Multiple Transforms
You can combine multiple transformations in one rule:
```css
transform: rotate(30deg) scale(1.2) translate(50px, 20px);
```

## Key differences Between 2D and 3D Transformations

| FEATURE     | 2D Transformations | 3D Transformations                    |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Axes        | X, Y               | X, Y, Z                               |
| Depth       | No depth effect    | Adds depth perception                 |
| Rotation    | Only in 2D         | Rotates around different axes         |
| Performance | Lightweight        | May be more performance-intensive<br> |
|             |                    |                                       |
Both 2D and 3D transformations help create interactive engaging UI effects in modern web design.

# Keyframes

The `@keyframes` rule in CSS is used to create animations by defining a sequence of style changes over time. It allows smooth transitions between different states of an element.

```css
@keyframes animation-name {
  0% { /* Initial state */ }
  25% { /* Midpoint state */ }
  50% { /* Midpoint state */ }
  75% { /* Midpoint state */ }
  100% { /* Final state */ }
}
```

You can then apply the animation using the `animation` property:
```css
div {
  animation: animation-name duration timing-function delay iteration-count direction;
}
```

## Key properties used with @keyframes

- `animation-name` - The name of the animation (match with `@keyframes` name)
- `animation-duration` - Time the animation takes to complete (2s, 500ms, etc..)
- `animation-timing-function` - Control the speed variation (linear, ease, ease-in, ease-out, etc...)
- `animation-delay` - Specifies a delay before starting the animation
- `animation-iteration-count` - Defines how many times the animations run (1, infinite, 3, etc.. )
- `animation-direction` - Specifies whether the animation reverses (normal, reverse, alternate)
- `animation-fill-mode` - Defines the state of the element before/after the animation (forwards, backwards, both)
- `animation-play-state` - Controls animation playback (running, paused)

## Why use `@keyframes`

- Creates smooth animations without JavaScript
- Reduces reliance on GIFs and heavy animation files
- Works well for UI/UX effects like loaders, hover effects, and transitions
With `@keyframes`, you can add creative and dynamic animations to your website easily
