This topics involve applying CSS filters to images with `filter` CSS attribute.
The `filter` attribute applies graphical effects like blur, brightness, contrast, and more to an element. It is commonly used for image manipulation but works on other elements as well.
# Grayscale(%)
Converts colors to grayscale.
- 0% is normal
- 100% makes it fully black and white

```css
filter: grayscale(30%)
filter: grayscale(0.3)
```
# Blur(px)
Applies a Gaussian blur to the element. The higher the value, the blurrier it appears.

```css
filter: blur(5px)
```
# Sepia(%)
Applies a warm, brownish tone.
- 0% is normal
- 100% gives a full sepia effect

```css
filter: sepia(50%)
filter: sepia(.5)
```
# Opacity(%)
Applies transparency. 
- 0% makes the image completely transparent
- 100% leaves the image unchanged.


```css
filter: opacity(30%)
filter: opacity(.3)
```
# Drop-shadow(x y blur color)
Adds a shadow to the element, similar to `box-shadow`, but works on transparent areas too.
```css
filter: drop-shadow(4px 4px 10px black)
```
# Saturate
Saturates the image
- 0% being completely unsaturated
- 100% leaving the image unchanged
- > 100% increasing saturation

```css
filter: saturate(130%)
```
